Description           : In late January of 2026, VTuber FioraAlmater played Doom for
						the first time. What occured were visions of horror, fear and
						terror not ever before seen by mankind.
						
						It also created a lot of funny sound clips which is the main 
						reason this WAD was made.
						
						When used, this WAD replaces all of the standard Doom Guy
						sounds and the level start sound with the funniest sound clips 
						Fiora made during her streams. 
						
						Additionally for IWADS and PWADS that use the Doom Guy graphics
						with their status bar, they are replaced with art of Fiora's 
						Fumo. As Fiora health decreases, her fear increases.
						If her health is reduced to 0, the fear overcomes her and she
						becomes a pathetic crying mess and you must restart the map.
						
						When using this WAD with other PWADS, it is recommended that 
						FearFumosAndFiora.WAD is added after other used PWADS to ensure
						the sounds and graphics are not overwritten by the other used
						PWADs.
						

Additional Credits to : FioraAlmater for streaming Doom & Doom 2, making funny noises
						and providing the audio clips.
